<p>The repository saw quite a bit of activity, especially around the architectural design and documentation. <em>Multiple commits</em> updated the <code>architechure.md</code> file culminating in the merging of pull request <code>#23</code>, effectively adding the system overview document. An issue was opened to <strong>measure power consumption</strong> and estimate battery life. A <code>docx</code>
 proposal was converted to Markdown and some plain text files were 
removed and updated. Google OAuth integration via Firebase is being 
explored, with a new issue created to track its implementation. Also, <code>Offset Debugging</code>
 received attention, with a fix for a double offset issue, and the 
addition of variables to the console for debugging. Furthermore, the 
repository gained the ability to display and save temperature logs with a
 graph and a dedicated table and work on implementing firebase database .

**CuriosityWeekends/TemPro**\n\nThe team was busy refining the project's
 architecture, with multiple commits updating `architecture.md` which

 proposal from `.docx` to markdown format.\nA new issue was opened to 
explore measuring power consumption using ampere, and estimating battery
 life during sleep states. Work has also begun on integrating _Google 
OAuth_ via Firebase with an issue opened to track it. This was followed 
by a flurry of commits that implemented firebase database, `temperature 
logs`, including the addition of a `FIREBASE.md` guide and table showing
 those logs. Additionally debugging enhancements and a _temperature log 
graph_ has been added with multiple commits updating `script.js` and 
`index.html` to incorporate the enhancements.\n\n## 
**CuriosityWeekends/lab**\n\nMultiple new issues were opened, indicating
 ongoing organization and planning. These include setting up a _git 
workshop_, creating a _GitHub account for Arshad_, dealing with the 
_chalk stand on the blackboard_, and adding a _printed sticker label_ to
 the tool board. Also added tasks for fixing the _tool board in a proper
 place_, and dealing with miscellaneous _hardware_. In addition an issue
 to `experiment with iron box` has been closed.\n\n##

**CuriosityWeekends/TemPro**\n\nThe repository saw quite a bit of 
activity, especially around the architectural design and documentation. 
_Multiple commits_ updated the `architechure.md` file culminating in the
 merging of pull request `#23`, effectively adding the system overview 
document. An issue was opened to **measure power consumption** and 
estimate battery life. A `docx` proposal was converted to Markdown and 
some plain text files were removed and updated. Google OAuth integration
 via Firebase is being explored, with a new issue created to track its 
implementation. Also, `Offset Debugging` received attention, with a fix 
for a double offset issue, and the addition of variables to the console 
for debugging. Furthermore, the repository gained the ability to display
 and save temperature logs with a graph and a dedicated table and work 
on implementing firebase database . \n\n## 
**CuriosityWeekends/lab**\n\nA series of new issues were opened in the 
`CuriosityWeekends/lab` repository, focusing on lab infrastructure and 
educational resources. These include requests for a \"git workshop\", 
creation of a GitHub account for Arshad, a chalk stand for the 
blackboard, printed sticker labels for the tool board, fixing the tool 
board in a proper place and requesting hardware. On the other hand, the 
issue for *\"Experiment with iron box\"* has been resolved and 
closed.\n\n## **hadinah/entrylogger**\n\nThis repository was forked and 
the changes related to forking and org details were added, culminating 
in pull request `#2` being merged from `CuriosityWeekends/main`. An 
earlier attempt to make a similar pull request `#1` was created and 
closed.\n\n## **CuriosityWeekends/.github**\n\nThe 
`CuriosityWeekends/.github` repository was updated with a change to the 
`Live Demo URL`, specifically pointing to the new 
`tempro.curiosityweekends.org` website demo.\n\n## 
**CuriosityWeekends/Voice-AI**\n\nThe `README.md` file in 
`CuriosityWeekends/Voice-AI` was updated.\n\n## 
**hadinah/Password-Generator**\n\n`Hadinah` has been working on the 
_Password-Generator_ project, specifically merging pull request `#1` to 
add a dark theme option. **\"Adding A Dark theme Option as-well\"** was 
the main goal, and changes included fixing window size and the eventual 
addition of the dark theme. A related pull request was opened in 
`Stratosss/Password-Generator` targeting *\"Adding A Dark theme Option 
as-well\"*.\n\n## **hadinah/hadinah**\n\nThere were several updates to 
the `README.md` in `hadinah/hadinah`. Moreover, a file `banner4.gif` was
 renamed to `mario.gif`, and some files were added via upload.\n"}</div></div>
